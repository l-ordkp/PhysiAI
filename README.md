# Multi-Agent System with LangGraph

This project implements a modular multi-agent architecture using LangGraph, featuring specialized agents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Email handling, Calendar management, and an Integrated Agent that routes tasks intelligently.

## Agents Overview

### 1. RAG Agent

The RAG agent processes user queries through several iterative steps to ensure groundedness and precision:

- Expands the user query for better retrieval
- Retrieves relevant documents/context
- Crafts a response based on retrieved data
- Scores the response for groundedness (relevance to context)
- Refines the response if grounding is weak
- Checks the precision of the response
- Refines the query if precision is low
- Repeats until response meets quality criteria or max iterations reached

### 2. Email Agent

Handles user intents related to email:

- Classifies the userâ€™s intent (send email, summarize unread emails, or end)
- Routes to the appropriate action node
- Executes email sending or unread email summarization

### 4. Integrated Agent

Acts as the top-level router, classifying user intent and dispatching to the correct specialized agent:

- Email Agent
- Calendar Agent
- RAG Agent
- Generic Question Handler
